# Flashcards CLI
This is a simple application that I developed while trying to learn both Rust application development and VIM shortcuts.

The Rust program is based off of [I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html)

The Flashcards CLI application is intended to read a JSON file with "Clue" and "Answer" pairs.
The application randomly select a flashcard and displays the "Clue" while monitoring the input stream for a matching "Answer".
